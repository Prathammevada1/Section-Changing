Project Improvement Checklist

1. Separation of Concerns

* Move tooltip creation logic out of Helper and fully into ToolTip.
* Keep Helper only responsible for generic DOM updates (e.g., switching list items).
* Keep ProjectList focused on managing the project data array.

2. Event Handling

* Prevent multiple tooltips from being added on repeated clicks.
* Ensure proper `this` binding in event listeners (.bind(this)).
* Consider event delegation for scalability (attach listener to <ul> instead of each <li>).
* Clean up event listeners if list items are moved between sections.

3. DOM Selection

* Avoid querySelector('button:first-of-type') or button:last-of-type.
* Add data attributes for buttons: <button data-action="info">More Info</button> <button data-action="switch">Finish</button>
* Use li.querySelector('[data-action="info"]') and li.querySelector('[data-action="switch"]').

4. ProjectList Management

* Initialize projects inside constructor to avoid shared reference:
  this.projects = [];
* Use cleaner array methods (filter) for moving projects instead of .splice().
* Consider separating project state from DOM for better maintainability.

5. Tooltip Creation & Cleanup

* Check for existing tooltip before creating a new one.
* Remove tooltip when the project moves to another list.
* Keep tooltip self-contained — all DOM manipulation happens inside ToolTip.

6. Code Maintainability

* Remove unused properties (e.g., sectionId in ToolTip).
* Separate UI update functions from business logic.
* Add comments for important logic blocks.
* Consistent naming for methods and variables.

7. Scalability

* Cache DOM references instead of querying repeatedly.
* Use event delegation for handling clicks on multiple <li> elements.
* Keep project state in JS objects and reflect updates to DOM, not the other way around.

8. General Improvements

* Add error handling for document.getElementById(id) returns null.
* Validate project attributes (data-extra-info) before use.
* Consider modularizing classes into separate files for clarity.
* Keep logic flexible for future addition of features (e.g., sorting, filtering).
